# StreamTrack  

## About  

With so many streaming and subscription services, itâ€™s difficult to track actual usage and determine the true value of memberships. **StreamTrack** is a **Java console application** 
that helps users manage subscriptions and log viewing sessions. By combining subscription cost with usage data, the app calculates a clear **cost-per-hour analysis**, helping users make informed decisions about which services are worth keeping.  

**Audience:** Individuals who subscribe to streaming platforms (Netflix, Twitch, YouTube Premium) or gaming services (World of Warcraft, Xbox Game Pass, Wizard101, etc.).  

**Goal:** Provide a simple, transparent way to evaluate subscription value through clear reporting and recommendations.
